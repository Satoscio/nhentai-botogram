# god why do i do this

Behold, the new nhentai bot, packed with a fuckton of new utilities
that **you will never use because you're a functioning member of society
and therefore you do not feel the urge to read hentai.**

This bot uses exentio's nhentai API Python wrapper, so you'll also
need to download his library to make this bot work

## Update 2020-10-07

### **I'm back on crack.**
* Updated `README.md`


### **FEATURES**
* **/random** - this command will generate a random ID between 1 and the
  latest nhentai ID
* **/latest** - do I have to tell you what this command does?
* **/search <ID>** - this command will search for a doujin with the ID you
  put next to the command
* **/info <ID>** - this command will give you detailed information about the doujin ID you
 put next to the command such as cover image (**I am not responsible if you get banned from a
  group because the cover image is NSFW**),
  titles (short, english, japanese), number of pages, author, language and all tags.
* **/start** - is this a feature?
* **/source** - it's not like I want other people to see my code, b-baka! *<-- I regret this*

### **NEW FEATURES**

* the **/info** command now displays the entry's category (be it manga or doujinshi)

### **REMOVED FEATURES**

* The bot will hate you if you search for 177013. Well, not really but it will write a chat message.

### **TO-DO**

* I removed the to-do stuff because it is unfeasible for a rookie like me. Fuck my life.

### **WORKING ON IT**

* Custom messages for certain characters, tags, etc.

## **BIG THANKS TO**

  for us @ https://github.com/exentio/nhentai_api
* [Michele](https://github.com/xMicky24GIT) for helping me with the
  Botogram framework *(I'm a fucking dumbass)*
* [Botogram](https://botogram.dev/) for making it easy to program a bot for Telegram.


### *Fun facts!*
* Fuck git
* No exentio, I don't want your fucking estrogens
